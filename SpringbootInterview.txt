 Certainly! Here are concise answers for each of the Spring interview questions:

1. **What is Spring Framework?**
   The Spring Framework is an open-source application framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. It is designed to simplify the development of enterprise applications by providing various features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and transaction management.

2. **What are the features of Spring Framework?**
   Key features include Inversion of Control (IoC), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), data access and transaction management, MVC web application framework, and support for various frameworks and libraries through integration.

3. **Why is Spring preferred over frameworks or core benefits of Spring Framework?**
   Spring offers modularity, flexibility, ease of testing, integration with other technologies, and a large community and support system. It simplifies enterprise-level application development and maintenance.

4. **What do you mean by IoC (Inversion of Control) Container?**
   IoC Container is a core component of the Spring Framework responsible for managing the lifecycle and configuration of application objects. It uses dependency injection to invert the control of object creation from the application code to the container.

5. **What are the benefits of IOC?**
   Benefits include decoupling object creation and management, improved code testability, easier maintenance, and the ability to manage complex dependencies.

6. **What are different modules in Spring Framework?**
   Core Container, AOP, Data Access/Integration (JDBC, ORM, JMS), Web (Spring MVC, WebSocket, WebFlux), Test, and more.

7. **What do you understand by Dependency Injection?**
   Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC, where the control of object creation and its dependencies is transferred from the object itself to an external container.

8. **How Can We Inject Beans in Spring?**
   Beans can be injected using constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection with annotations like @Autowired, @Inject, and XML configuration.

9. **Which Is the Best Way of Injecting Beans?**
   Constructor injection is often preferred for mandatory dependencies as it ensures that the object is created with all its dependencies.

10. **Explain the bean scopes supported by Spring?**
    Bean scopes include singleton, prototype, request, session, global session, and application.

11. **How to Define the Scope of a Bean?**
    The scope of a bean can be defined using the @Scope annotation or the `scope` attribute in XML configuration.

12. **Explain Spring Bean Life Cycle?**
    The bean lifecycle includes instantiation, dependency injection, initialization (via @PostConstruct, InitializingBean), and destruction (via @PreDestroy, DisposableBean).

13. **Which DI would you suggest Constructor-based or setter-based DI?**
    Constructor-based DI is recommended for mandatory dependencies, while setter-based DI is useful for optional dependencies.

14. **What are different types of auto wiring?**
    Autowiring types include no, byName, byType, constructor, and autodetect.

15. **What is the difference between Tight Coupling and Loose Coupling?**
    Tight coupling refers to classes being highly dependent on each other, making changes difficult, whereas loose coupling minimizes dependencies, enhancing flexibility and testability.

16. **What is the difference between a singleton and a prototype bean?**
    Singleton beans have a single instance per Spring container, whereas prototype beans create a new instance each time they are requested.

17. **Which is the default scope of bean in Spring? and, are they synchronized?**
    The default scope is singleton, and singleton beans are not thread-safe by default. Synchronization must be handled explicitly if needed.

18. **Explain the concept of Autowiring.**
    Autowiring is a feature that enables the Spring container to automatically resolve and inject dependencies by inspecting the bean configuration.

19. **Spring vs Spring MVC vs Spring Boot**
    Spring is the core framework, Spring MVC is a web framework for building web applications, and Spring Boot simplifies Spring application development with convention-over-configuration and embedded servers.

20. **Why do we use application.properties?**
